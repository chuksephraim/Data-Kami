# Titanic Survival Prediction

Analyze Titanic passenger data to identify key survival factors and build machine learning models to predict survival.

## Dataset

- `train.csv`: Passenger data with survival labels  
- `test.csv`: Passenger data for prediction

## Project Structure

- `data/` – raw data files  
- `notebooks/` – analysis and modeling notebook  
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## Workflow

1. Load and clean data  
2. Explore and visualize key features  
3. Engineer useful variables  
4. Train and evaluate models  
5. Summarize insights and results

## Setup

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
